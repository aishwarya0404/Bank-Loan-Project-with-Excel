DASHBOARD 1: SUMMARY
"In order to monitor and assess our bank's lending activities and performance, we need to create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help us make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies."

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:
1) Total Loan Applications
2) Total Funded Amount
3) Total Amount Received
4) Average Interest Rate
5) Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)

Good Loan v Bad Loan KPIâ€™s
In order to evaluate the performance of our lending activities and assess the quality of our loan portfolio, we need to create a comprehensive report that distinguishes between 'Good Loans' and 'Bad Loans' based on specific loan status criteria

Good Loan KPIs:
1) Good Loan Application Percentage
2) Good Loan Applications
3) Good Loan Funded Amount
4) Good Loan Total Received Amount

Bad Loan KPIs:
1) Bad Loan Application Percentage
2) Bad Loan Applications
3) Bad Loan Funded Amount
4) Bad Loan Total Received Amount

Loan Status Grid View
In order to gain a comprehensive overview of our lending operations and monitor the performance of loans, we aim to create a grid view report categorized by 'Loan Status.' This report will serve as a valuable tool for analysing and understanding the key indicators associated with different loan statuses. By providing insights into metrics such as 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received,' 'Month-to-Date (MTD) Funded Amount,' 'MTD Amount Received,' 'Average Interest Rate,' and 'Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI),' this grid view will empower us to make data-driven decisions and assess the health of our loan portfolio.

DASHBOARD 2: OVERVIEW
In our Bank Loan Report project, we aim to visually represent critical loan-related metrics and trends using a variety of chart types. These charts will provide a clear and insightful view of our lending operations, facilitating data-driven decision-making and enabling us to gain valuable insights into various loan parameters. Below are the specific chart requirements:
1) Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart)
2) Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map)
3) Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart)
4) Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart)
5) Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart)
6) Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map)

DASHBOARD 3: DETAILS
In our Bank Loan Report project, we recognize the need for a comprehensive 'Details Dashboard' that provides a consolidated view of all the essential information within our loan data. This Details Dashboard aims to offer a holistic snapshot of key loan-related metrics and data points, enabling users to access critical information efficiently.

Objective:
The primary objective of the Details Dashboard is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for accessing vital loan data. It will serve as a one-stop solution for users seeking detailed insights into our loan portfolio, borrower profiles, and loan performance.

The data set used "financial_loan.csv" has been uploaded.

The final project with all the three dashboard is "Bank Loan Project" and is uploaded.

The images of how summary dashboard,overview dashboard,details dashboard after the completion of project has been uploaded.
